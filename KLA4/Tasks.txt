1. Define Interface for ICalulateTax with following function
int AddTax(int itemPrice)
2. The function calculate the tax
3. Create class EilatPrice that implements ICalulateTax, the function AddTax returns item price with 0 percent for item
4. Create class PituachAreaPrice that implements ICalulateTax interface, the function AddTax returns item price with 5 percent for item
5. Create class OtherPrice that implements ICalulateTax interface, the function AddTax returns item price with 17 percent for item
6. Create PurchaseItem class with following function
6.1 Constractor(ICalulateTax calcMothod) , save this value in relevant property
6.2 PrintPrice(int price) 
6. From program get from user item price and area code (1 for Eilat. 2 for PituachArea 3 for Other)
calculate the price according to relevant class implementation

Project References
1. Create ClassLibrary project
2. Add class UtilityStrings with function string CombineString(string str1, string str2) 
that combited 2 strings to one string and retern it
3. Create Windows Form Application
by Tool box drag button to form and do double click to implement function
(see https://github.com/haimnewclass/KLA-CS/blob/master/KLA4/Images/W.bmp)
add reference the ClassLibrary you created and use the UtilityStrings
use CombineString function

////////

Create a C# program that implements an abstract class Animal that has a Name property of type text and three methods SetName (string name), GetName and Eat.
The Eat method will be an abstract method of type void.

You will also need to create a Dog class that implements the above Animal class and the Eat method that print "Bone is eatten 5 times".
You will also need to create a Bird class that implements the above Animal class and the Eat method that print "Bread is eatten" 1 time.


To test the program ask the user for a dog name and create a new Dog type object from the Main of the program, give the Dog object a name, and then execute the GetName and Eat methods.
same to Bird class
